The goal of the Predictive Indicator Identification Tool (PIIT) is to provide a functional capability to autonomously identify granular variances in data surrounding events of interest including, but not limited to, all virtual persona’s whether an individual, system, location, or object and locations.  The system runs on hardware that is realistic for a home user to obtain and utilize.  The system will be able to establish relationships that identify predictive indicators and the probability of occurrence of a particular event. This will allow the identification of threats prior to the threat being realized or occurring, allowing the security operations teams time to effectively and efficiently plan, prepare and execute operations to monitor, interdict or disrupt a probable event. 

PIIT  has the ability to establish relationships between people, objects, and locations. Utilizing a slight variant on Wisdom of the Crowds principle the system will be able to identify precursor information shown to be associated through a domino effect, or related such that previous unrelated events will infer the eventual happening of a particular event of interest. The autonomous analytical system limits or prevents human bias and error as a factor, therefore producing more accurate results.

Data is broken up into buckets for efficient resource utilization; speeding up processing time. Step one, the process starts by ingesting large amounts relevant data and allocate it based on a time or size metric and date and time (all configurable). The second step produces a file where multiple lines, each containing a string or symbol and the count for the string or symbol providing statically relevant information for a specified time period. This file will contain a line for each string used. The third step outputs a file containing a moving string baseline. This file contains all strings, their mean, median, total number of uses, the number of files processed from the second step, and the standard deviation. This file is calculated daily and accounts for all strings. The fourth step processes the previously generated files and outputs another file. This file contains the date time stamp of the file it maps to, from step 2, the words and deviation for any words that exist outside of the norm, utilizing the three-sigma rule. It will also contain a + or – to differentiate it following bellow or above. The fifth step is shown in detail below, in diagram 1 as it provides the logic behind the determination of predictive indicators.
